# DFKDE implementation provenance and reproducibility notes

This public summary is derived from the [method status inventory](method_status.json). It records the available repository-local provenance and validation boundary; it is not an assertion that the cited paper results can be independently reproduced from a clean public clone.

## Release status

- **Validation status:** Historical evidence
- **Public validation evidence distributed:** No
- **Runtime state:** <code>not_assessed</code> — Runtime availability has not been fully assessed; no clean-clone blocker was established beyond the separately recorded evidence and license limitations.
- **Method family:** Feature-memory / density
- **Registry entry:** <code>DFKDEDetector</code>
- **Detector module:** <code>baoiad.models.detectors.dfkde</code>

## Public references

- **Paper:** Not recorded in the release inventory.
- **Source repository:** [https://github.com/open-edge-platform/anomalib](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/anomalib)
- **Source revision:** [4f6af1acb0ee7b81f54cda036dd9f1c27f63b69a](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/anomalib/commit/4f6af1acb0ee7b81f54cda036dd9f1c27f63b69a)
- **Config README:** [configs/dfkde/README.md](../../configs/dfkde/README.md)
- **Release records:** [method status](method_status.json) · [known exceptions](exceptions.json) · [compliance checker](../../tools/check_release_compliance.py)

## Implementation differences

MMEngine integration; the method is image-level and emits a uniform map only for interface compatibility.

## Limitations

- Pixel output is not a localized anomaly estimate in the reference ontology.
- Referenced raw evidence is not distributed.
